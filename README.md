# CS61C Classify
This is a project from CS 61C class Fall 2019 of University of California, Berkeley.

The purpose of this project is to have you implement a simple, yet extremely useful system in RISC-V assembly language. You will learn to use registers efficiently, write functions, use calling conventions for calling your functions, as well as external ones, allocate memory on the stack and heap, work with pointers and more!

Our final goal is constructing a simple Artificial Neural Net (ANN), which will be able to classify handwritten digits to their actual number!
